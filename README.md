# DATA 351 Project

While you should feel free to use this repository as a method of sharing information or work between you and your group, it's primary use should be to upload the final deliverables of the project. That means:

- [ ] The presentation slides
- [ ] The problem and solution PDFs
- [ ] The database dump, assuming that it is small enough to fit

If anything can't be uploaded, you should edit this file to include links to where that information can be found.
